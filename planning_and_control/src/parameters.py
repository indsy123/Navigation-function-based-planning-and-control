Created on Tue Oct  3 11:17:34 2017
Defines all the parameters of various acstec helicopters measured from testing
in the lab. Unless otherwise mentioned the units are SI. however, I may change 
them as I develop this script, will try to write as much as I can whereever 
there is a deviation from SI units.  
defined parameters are as follows: 
mass: mass of the vehicle
inertia: moment of inertia of the vehicle 
CG_to_CoR: distance between center of gravity of the vehicle to the center of 
rotation of the propeller 
kx: gain of the position error 
kv: gain of the velocity error 
kR: gain of the rotation error 
kOmega: gain of the angular velocity error 
tau_t: thrust constant of the propeller (assuming f = tau_t*w^2)
tau_m: moment constant of the propeller   
change the diagonal entries in inertia and gain matrices to change the values 
in x, y and z direction. off-diagonal entries should be zero. May have 
off-diagonal terms in inertia matrix if there is a reason to do so later. 
Somehow this long thing is working but its stupid. need to find a way to make 
it short by calling self.uav outside the function definition.
